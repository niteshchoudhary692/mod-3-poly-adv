### Overview
This Circom circuit template is designed to verify whether a given value c is the correct result of the multiplication of two other values, a and b. The circuit employs AND, NOT, and OR gates to perform the necessary computations and logic checks.

### Circuit Logic
The circuit follows a straightforward logic pattern to determine if c is the product of a and b:

An AND gate computes the product of a and b, assigning the result to the signal x.
A NOT gate negates the value of b, assigning the result to the signal y.
An OR gate combines signals x and y, determining whether either value is true.
The final output q represents the outcome of the OR gate, indicating if c is the result of the multiplication of a and b.
Components
The circuit template is structured using various component templates, each representing a logic gate:

AND(): Implements the logic for an AND gate.
OR(): Implements the logic for an OR gate.
NOT(): Implements the logic for a NOT gate.
GateLogic123(): Combines the gates to construct the main logic for checking the multiplication.
